# Shopping Assistant Project
This project demonstrates predicting a customer’s next basket of items using [data on Instacart customers’ prior orders](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data). The model’s predictive abilities are exposed as a web application which will present to the user an interface to add products to a basket. As products are added, the model tries to predict what additional items will be added and suggest them to the user.
